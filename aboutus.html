            <p class="para">We are five students who are working as a team to design and build softwares. Our team consist of one officer cadet and four day-scholars. According to the requests made by our friends we design this software named MarshalFitness to monitor the physical fitness of cadets as many of them are failing their monthly physical fitness test.
                We created this website, so the cadets are free to use this website and they can view their profiles and schedule, can do the exercises according to the schedule and improve their muscles. Here, we created highly functional user interfaces with the perfect mixture of simplicity and with innovations for each of our cadets.
                We are simply studying problems and do what we can do to reduce or remove them by giving it an innovative solution with highly functional user interfaces.</p>
